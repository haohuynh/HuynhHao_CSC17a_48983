File Filter
A file filter reads an input file, transforms it in some way, and writes the results to an output
file. Write an abstract file filter class that defines a pure virtual function for transforming
a character. Create one derived class of your file filter class that performs encryption,
another that transforms a file to all uppercase, and another that creates an unchanged
copy of the original file. The class should have the following member function:
void doFilter(ifstream &in, ofstream &out)
This function should be called to perform the actual filtering. The member function for
transforming a single character should have the prototype:
char transform(char ch)
The encryption class should have a constructor that takes an integer as an argument
and uses it as the encryption key.
